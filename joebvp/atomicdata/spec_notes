make very simple fake Spectrum
XSpectrum1D from linetools
see how continuum fitting output differs from XSpectrum1D
go through whatever VPmeasure does <--- or specifically the setting up the cfg parts of it
and from there it should be something that can be put into our veeper stuff

go through same process with input spectrum containing actual line flux

main change from now fill be addition of continuum list
