Steps to go from werksquad .json file to inputting components into the veeper:

  from joebvp import utils

  utils.pyigm_to_veeper('galaxyname.json', 'galaxyname.fits')

This will create a directory with text files corresponding to each group of
absorption features in the spectrum. Each one of these files is now ready to be
put into the veeper for fitting:

  from joebvp import VPmeasure

  VPmeasure.batch_fit('galaxyname.fits', ['componentname1.txt'], filepath='./component_groups/')

Keep in mind batch_fit can accept at many component arguments as you want to give it,
I've just shown it with one. The filepath argument will default to the working directory if
not specified. Given that pyigm_to_veeper automatically creates a subdirectory for the
input files, not including the above will produce an error.
A successful fit will end with something like this:

  VPmeasure: 1/1 fits converged, 0/1 failed (see log for details).

  VPmeasure: concatenating individual outputs and creating figures for inspection.

  .
  .
  .

  Wrote spectrum to FitInspection.fits
  VPmeasure: Done.

If you want to check your fit, among the plethora of files veeper created are some fit inspection files called
FitInspection. Congratulations on your new fitted QSO sightline absorption!
